Instructions:
1. Always import the list of music files you want to play first. Doing otherwise will result in errors. The program will not crash however, a error box is not implemented.
2. When an operation is in progress the Program Status indicater in the middle of the panel, will switch from 'Ready' in Green to 'Loading' in Yellow. This sometimes takes a few seconds to happen. Pressing the button again may cancel out the action. Pressing another button may also do this.
3. Changing the equaliser only applies to the graph and song playing when the apply button is clicked, the reset button and presets automatically apple.
4. Pressing any of the four buttons to order the songs will pause and restart the music (review documentation for more).
5. You can edit the current song details and either save it as a new file or replace the current file. By default a new file is made, this can be changed using the drop box. Simply type in the details and choose the file type.

*Please note. I know Equaliser is spelt with an s. This is named after the movie for dramatic effect. It is the Equalizer of Music Players.
